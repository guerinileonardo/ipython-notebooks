      "The original task was to generate the SDP relaxations of arbitrarily complex polynomial optimization problems of noncommuting variables, that is, the most general form of the NPA hierarchy [1] -- the tool for this conversion is called [Ncpol2sdpa](http://peterwittek.github.io/ncpol2sdpa/) [2]. Development started in MATLAB, with an eye on the libraries that achieve the same purpose for the Lasserre hierarchy, [Gloptipoly](http://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/software/gloptipoly/) and [SparsePOP](http://sparsepop.sourceforge.net/). Hence the approach was more algebraic from the beginning, rather than directly manipulating SDPs with [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), [SeDuMi](http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/), or [Yalmip](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/). Thus first it can be counterintuitive to use the library for quantum correlations. To further complicate things, MATLAB's noncommutative symbolic algebra capabilities were insufficient, hence development switched to using Python. The purpose of this notebook is to give a taste how it works.\n",

      "We found that the most difficult part is getting Python running with the necessary libraries. By far the easiest solution is to download [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), which bundles all necessary libraries and tools needed on Windows, Linux, and OS X. This is especially preferred if you are using a restricted computer where you do not have admin rights. You can then install the current stable version of Ncpol2sdpa by typing ``pip install ncpol2sdpa`` on the command line. Other relevant libraries could prove more difficult to install, but we won't detail that here. If all works fine, you should be able to import all functions from the module:"
